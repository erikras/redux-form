Another way to allow the shape of a form to alter dynamically is to specify fields as a function of the previous value of fields that outputs a new list of fields. Thus, when a form is changed, the fields that are on the form can be dynamically determined.

Below is an example that allows a form to alter itself based on its current values. In addition to simple boolean values, whether or not a field has been edited, or properties of the value of the field can be used to determine form elements.
